# module-1-challenge

## Description

This project was an opportunity for me to practice refactoring code. I enjoyed the experience and challenged myself to create something that was as close to a professional as I could at my current skill level. Using the acceptance criteria as a guide, I made changes to both the HTML and CSS which I feel improved the look and feel of the webpage, along with the organization of the code. In a real world scenario, I feel this would make the code more manageable for the developer(s) who have to maintain and update it in the future.

One major lesson I learned while working on this project is to make more comments in the code when I am working with code that I did not write. I was very excited to begin improving the code and layout, so I just started making changes without noting everything I changed from the original code. This made it difficult for me to remember all the changes I made when I went to add clarifying comments to my code later.

Also, as I am ready to commit my code to the repo, I realized another lesson I learned. I should be committing changes to my code regularly to the repo as I am learning to work as a professional developer. I am used to working on a project locally from start to finish before I do anything like uploading or pushing it somewhere else. As I learn to work with other developers, I need to commit small changes much more often.
